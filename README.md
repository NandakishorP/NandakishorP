# 💫 About Me:

I'm a smart contract developer building cross-chain stuff and learning what breaks in production.



Working on a cross-chain lending protocol with Chainlink CCIP - it's about 6k lines of Solidity dealing with state sync across chains. The hard part isn't the lending logic, it's keeping everything consistent when messages are flying between chains.

Also going deep on testing and security and peeking into the internals of EVM.


#What I know

**Smart Contracts:**
- Solidity (obviously)
- Foundry for testing and deployment
- Hardhat when I need to

**Testing:**
- Unit tests, fuzz tests, invariant tests
- Still learning formal verification with Certora
- Trying to catch bugs before they're expensive

**Cross-Chain:**
- Built with CCIP, understand the architecture
- Designed modular contracts (Vault, LoanManager, CollateralManager)
- Know why cross-chain is hard (spoiler: everything can fail)

**Full Stack:**
- Can build frontends (React, Next.js)
- Subgraph indexing with GraphQL
- ethers.js, wagmi, all that

## Projects

**Cross-Chain Lending Protocol** - The big one. Lets you deposit collateral on one chain, borrow on another. State managers, state mirrors, CCIP message handling. Still adding tests and finding edge cases.

**Single-Chain Lending** - Simpler DeFi protocol I built to learn the basics. Fully tested, actually works.

Check the repos below for details.

## What I'm Learning

Right now: Gas optimization (learning Yul), formal verification, and security patterns that actually matter in production.

Later: Advanced DeFi mechanics, then ZK stuff when I understand the prereqs.


🚀 Looking For
Part-time smart contract work while I finish college. I can take a feature from contract → tests → frontend integration and ship it. Available ~20–25 hrs/week, totally fine with async.
